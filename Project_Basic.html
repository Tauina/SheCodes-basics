    <strong>Madeira</strong>, officially the Autonomous Region of Madeira, is one of the two autonomous regions of
    Portugal. It is an archipelago situated in the North Atlantic Ocean, in a region known as Macaronesia, near Canary
    Islands and Morocco.
    <br>
    The capital of Madeira is <strong>Funchal</strong>, which is located on the main island's south coast. The
    archipelago includes the
    islands of <strong>Madeira</strong>, <strong>Porto Santo</strong>, and the <strong>Desertas</strong>.
    <br>
    Madeira generally has a very
    mild and moderate subtropical climate with mediterranean summer droughts and winter rain. Many microclimates are
    found
    at different elevations.
    <br>
    Madeira, originally uninhabited, was claimed by <strong>Portuguese</strong> sailors in the service of Prince
    Henrique,
    the Navigator, in
    <strong>1419</strong>.
